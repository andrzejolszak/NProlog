 * Returns specialised implementations of {@link Predicate}.

 * There are two general types of predicates:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>User defined predicates</i> are defined by a mixture of rules and facts constructed from Prolog syntax
 * consulted at runtime.</li>
 * <li><i>Built-in predicates</i> are written in Java. Built-in predicates can provide facilities that would not be
 * possible using pure Prolog syntax. The two predicates that are always available in Projog are
 * {@code pl_add_predicate/2} and {@code pl_add_arithmetic_operator/2}. The {@code pl_add_predicate/2} predicate allows
 * other predicates to be "plugged-in" to Projog.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Rather than directly implementing {@code PredicateFactory} it is recommended to extend either
 * {@link org.projog.core.predicate.AbstractSingleResultPredicate} or
 * {@link org.projog.core.predicate.AbstractPredicateFactory}.
